/**
 * Service Worker Placeholder (sw.js)
 *
 * This file provides a minimal service worker with basic install and fetch handlers.
 * It is not currently registered or used by the application, but could be considered
 * a foundation for potential future enhancements such as offline support or caching.
 *
 * At present, it has no effect on the appâ€™s behavior and can be safely left in place.
 * Future developers may build on this if service worker functionality is desired.
